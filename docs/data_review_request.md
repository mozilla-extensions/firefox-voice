# Request for data collection review form

**All questions are mandatory. You must receive review from a data steward peer on your responses to these questions before shipping new data collection.**

1) What questions will you answer with this data?

2) Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions?  Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements? Some example responses:

* Establish baselines or measure changes in product or platform quality or performance.

* Provide information essential for advancing a business objective such as supporting OKRs.

* Determine whether a product or platform change has an effect on user or browser behavior.

3) What alternative methods did you consider to answer these questions? Why were they not sufficient?

4) Can current instrumentation answer these questions?

5) List all proposed measurements and indicate the category of data collection for each measurement, using the Firefox [data collection categories](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) on the Mozilla wiki.   

**Note that the data steward reviewing your request will characterize your data collection based on the highest (and most sensitive) category.**
